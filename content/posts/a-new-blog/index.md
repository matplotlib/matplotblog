Matplotlib is an open-source Python visualization library. As such, there are a multitude of contributors and users that assist in improving matplotlib and expanding its reach every day. They have helped it to become what it is and help show the world what is possible with a (relatively) little Python code. 

To further help matplotlib users make impressive visualizations and to ultimately tell impactful stories with their data, we have created this blog. This new site will be home to news affecting the matplotlib community, tutorials, and other relevant content. 

It is our hope that as we continue to move forward with the project, matplotlib users will enjoy and derive much benefit from the posts contained here.
