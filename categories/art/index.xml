The emphasis is on practical, hands-on active learning.
The students completed the assignment with festive enthusiasm around Halloween. Here are some great examples:

I wanted to use it to transform my mundane Facebook profile picture to something more snazzy. The only trouble? It was written in Rust.
So instead of going through the process of installing Rust, I decided to take the easy route and spin up some code to do the same in Python using matplotlib.
Because that's what anyone sane would do, right?</description></item></channel></rss>
